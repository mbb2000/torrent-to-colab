# torrent-to-colab
Direct download torrent files to google colab.

You can choose what folders to download from the .torrent file.

The structure of torrent folders should look like this:

Main_foler
-    |....second_folder_1
-                        |....
-                       |....
-   |....second_folder_2
-                        |....
-                       |....        
-   |....second_folder_3
-                       |....
-                       |....
                        
However, if the folder structure is not the same, you can edit some of the codes on your own to fit your desire download method.

after finishing download, you can either move the downloaded folder to your Google drive or download it directly.
Good Luck :)
